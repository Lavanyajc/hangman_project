# hangman_project
hello, in  this code  you gonna see hangman game ,to begin with chosen word ,its going to be random chosen words from the list  so why we imported random module 
you can also import any list modules or any modules easily without code changes by just adding it in the code 
If you need  clear explanation of this code -> refer below:
1. In order to make computer chosen word random we use random.choice() by importing random module
2. to display '_' in place of lettters in chosen word we use empty list and for loop  to iterate through each letter in chosenword
3.we gave lifelines for user as lives=some number and have taken input from user as guess
4.follow condition 1  to assign letter to '_' if letter matches in chosen word and  print statement if user enters the same letter when it is alredy entered.
5. follow condition 2 if letter has not matches.
6. follow condition 3  when there is no blank spaces'_'.
